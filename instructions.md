# About

Start9 Pages provides a simple way to host custom websites on StartOS. Your website could be a blog, a resume, a portfolio, a business landing page, a product brochure, or just a set of files that you want to share with the world.

Start9 Pages lets you host a homepage at any clearnet domain or Tor URL. For example, one site could be `xxxxxxxx.onion` and another could be `blog.mydomain.com`. 

# Instructions

To configure a website's hosted folder:

1. First, upload the files for your website to File Browser, or to Nextcloud's "Files".
1. Then, select the service you uploaded to for the folder location.
1. Finally, enter the path to the website folder. For example, you create a folder in File Browser called "websites", and another folder inside that one called "blog". Entering the path of websites/blog would tell Start9 Pages that it can find the blog files inside that path in File Browser.

**NOTE:** Folder Paths are case sensitive. Nextcloud folders are capitalized by default, so be sure to input them accordingly.
